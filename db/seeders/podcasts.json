    "description": "Tim Ferriss is a self-experimenter and bestselling author, best known for The 4-Hour Workweek, which has been translated into 40+ languages.  Newsweek calls him \"the world's best human guinea pig,\" and The New York Times calls him \"a cross between Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk.\"  In this show, he deconstructs world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, chess, pro sports, etc.), digging deep to find the tools, tactics, and tricks that listeners can use.",
